//Explain me the architechture of playwright 

playwright is designed to provide a seemless autoamtion experince for modern web application 
playwirght acheives this by offering fast, reliable and cross-complatibility 

playwright works on web socket connection protcol (unlike selenium and cypress which works on https protocol)

on clients side you can have your tests in various coded langauges (eg js , typescript)
playwright servers communicates with the client side using web socket connection protocol 
it communicates with the browser (cdp) (chrome dev protocol) and with rest (firefox , safari)

the clinet server communcation happens through web scoket protocol in hand shake way (communivation happens both way )

when you trigger a testcases for the first time  your testcases is converted in json format 
this json format is transmitted to the server side using a single websckoet protocol then all the request are transfered using this
single connection so this lessens the chances if failure and flakyness and also increases the speed of automation giveing playwright edge over other tools 
 

 has its own :-  

 test runner :- integrate in selenium,
 API Library :- integrate in selenium,
 Page Object , 
 inbuilt methods , assertions
